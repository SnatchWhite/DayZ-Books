DayZ Books

Unfortunately books can't be read in Vanila DayZ at the moment, but they do make an interesting addition to the game.

In this repository there are two files, the full list and a reduced list. The reduced list also has a nominal value of "1"
for each book, to reduce the load on your server.

Choose which version you want, and copy the contents to your types.xml file.

Thanks, Rob.
